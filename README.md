#Network Algorithm ![test status](https://travis-ci.org/htfy96/network_algo.svg?branch=master)
This project is a framework of network analysis. It is designed to provide the following features:
 - Building graph from various sources(e.g MYSQL)
 - Implementation of some network algorithms.

It is still at very early stage, so use it as your own risk.

##Clone & Build
